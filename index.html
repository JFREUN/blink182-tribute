  <h3>1999</h3>
  <h4>The big break</h4>
  <p>With the release of the group's third album Enema of the State in June 1999, Blink-182 was catapulted to stardom and became the biggest pop punk act of the era.[38][failed verification] Three singles were released from the record—"What's My Age Again?", "All the Small Things", and "Adam's Song"—which became major radio hits.</p>
